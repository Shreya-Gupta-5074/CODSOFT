# CodSoft Python Internship Projects 🐍 (CLI Edition)

Welcome to my repository! This collection features the projects I completed during my **Python Programming Internship** at **CodSoft**. 

These applications are built purely using **Python's standard libraries**, focusing on backend logic, algorithmic efficiency, and command-line interface (CLI) interaction.

## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1. To-Do List (CLI) 📝
A terminal-based application to manage daily tasks efficiently.
* **Functionality:** Users can add tasks, view the current list, and delete completed tasks via text commands.
* **Key Concepts:** Lists, loops, and conditional branching to create a menu-driven interface.

### 2. Simple Calculator 🧮
A text-based calculator that performs arithmetic operations.
* **Functionality:** Takes user input for numbers and operations (+, -, *, /) and displays the result directly in the terminal.
* **Key Concepts:** Functions, type conversion.

### 3. Password Generator 🔐
A script that generates secure, random passwords.
* **Functionality:** Prompts the user for the desired password length and outputs a complex combination of characters.
* **Key Concepts:** The `random` and `string` modules, string manipulation, and input validation.

### 4. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game ✂️
An interactive text game played against the computer.
* **Functionality:** The user types their choice, and the program randomly selects a counter-move to determine the winner based on game rules.
* **Key Concepts:** Randomization, `while` loops for replayability, and game logic implementation.

### 5. Contact Book 📒
A console-based contact management system.
* **Functionality:** A menu system allows users to Add, Search, and Delete contacts using names as keys.
* **Key Concepts:** Python Dictionaries (key-value pairs), CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and string formatting.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Interface:** Command Line Interface (CLI) / Terminal
* **Libraries:** `random`, `string` (Standard Python Libraries only)
